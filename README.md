# Petroleum Engineering TTU
In this project, for my Advanced Reservoir Simulation course, I created a numerical simulation program in MATLAB using IMPES (Implicit Pressure-Explicit Saturation) method for pressure draw-down in a hypothetical, 2D variable grid, shale gas reservoir block having a fracture. The results were verified by running the parameters through a commercial simulator (Eclipse).

Also inclued is my Master's Report from Texas Tech University, a case study on the Wolfcamp formation in the Permian Basin.

  <h4>Given a 2D variable grid reservoir with a single point of prodction and connected fracture,
  apply IMPES (Implicit Pressure, Explicit Saturation) to model pressure drawdown with time.</h4>
