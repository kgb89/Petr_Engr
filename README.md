# Petroleum Engineering TTU
Included are a couple projects from my masters program at Texas Tech University:

1. Master's Report
2. PETR5309 Adv. Reservoir Engineering project:
  - Given a 2D variable grid reservoir with a single point of prodction and connected fracture.
  - Apply IMPES (Implicit Pressure, Explicit Saturation) to model pressure drawdown with time.
