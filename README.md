# Petroleum Engineering TTU
Included are a couple projects from my masters program at Texas Tech University:

<h2>1. Master's Report</h2>
<h2>2. PETR5309 Adv. Reservoir Engineering project:</h2>
  <h3>Given a 2D variable grid reservoir with a single point of prodction and connected fracture.</h3>
  <h3>Apply IMPES (Implicit Pressure, Explicit Saturation) to model pressure drawdown with time.</h3>
